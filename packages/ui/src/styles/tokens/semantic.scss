/**
 * Layer 2: Semantic Tokens
 *
 * These tokens define the purpose and meaning of colors in the UI.
 * They map primitive tokens to semantic use cases.
 * Components should reference these through Tailwind classes.
 *
 * NOTE: The actual semantic token definitions are now in the theme files.
 * This file imports the default theme to maintain backward compatibility.
 * To use a different theme, apply the theme class to the root element.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Single source of truth for theming
 * - Easy dark/light mode switching
 * - Consistent color usage across components
 * - Simple customization by overriding these tokens
 * - Multiple pre-built themes available
